	Periodic_table.csv was taken from GoodmanSciences

10/11/2021
I've been able to read the Periodic_table.csv file into a structure using
	malloc - to allocate space needed to utilize all 118 elements
	fopen - obviously to open Periodic_table.csv in read mode
	fgets - to pull the rows from Periodic_table.csv into a buffer that is 318 bytes long
	strdup - to make a copy of buffer for manipulaltion
	strtok_r - to call each item deliminated by ","
	strcpy - to copy the field from strtok_r into the structure
	atoi - to change the data from char*/string to an integer
	atof - to change the data from a char*/string to a float
	fclose - to close Periodic_table.csv
